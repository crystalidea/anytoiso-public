[Create a new issue](https://github.com/crystalidea/anytoiso-public/issues) when having anything related to [AnyToISO](https://crystalidea.com/anytoiso).

**2. Translate the app**

[AnyToISO translations](/languages) are plain UTF-8 .xml files. You can either create a pull request or send us your translated XML via e-mail.
